# 🌍🔊Translate and Speak : Multilingual for English Input
***Built with Streamlit, Gemini API, gTTS and OCR file support.***

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

[🚀 Live Demo (Click Here!)](https://genaitranslate-and-speak-5frsypnc9p7vm4xgk5xxcj.streamlit.app/) **Only accessible while API KEY exists**
 
Translate English text into dozens of languages and hear it spoken aloud — all in one smooth, easy-to-use web app with audio download included.

Simply input your English text (or upload a file!), choose your target language, and receive both the translated text and a downloadable audio file.

## 🧭Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application in you local machine

### 1. 📝Prerequisites
* Python 3.10
* Python package installer `pip`
* **Poppler Utilities** required for PDF processing.
    *   **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install poppler`
    *   **Linux (apt-get):** `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils`
    *   **Windows:** Download from [here](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) Ensure it's added to your PATH.


### 2. 🧬Clone the repository

Clone to your local machine in your desired project folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcadriaans/translate-and-speak.git
```

### 3. ⚙️Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's best practice to use a virtual environment.

<b>For Windows (cmd)</b>
```cmd
uv venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
(If you encounter script execution issues, you might need to run:
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

<b>For macOS/Linux</b>
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. 📦Install Dependencies
Install all neccessary Python packages:
```cmd
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
❗Note: EasyOCR models (craft_mlt_25k.pth, english_g2.pth) are included in the ml_models/easyocr directory. Ensure these are present for OCR functionality.

### 5. 🔑Configure Your Gemini API Key
This application requires a Google Gemini API key.
1. Generate a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat)
2. Create a file named <b>`.env`</b> in the root of your project directory.
3. Add your API key to this file:
```python
GOOGLE_API_KEY = your_api_key_here
```
Replace your_api_key_here with you actual key.

### 6. 🚀Launch the Application
Activate the virtual enviroment, configure the API key and then run the application in cmd:
```cmd
streamlit run translator_app.py
```
Your default web browser will open the application, ready for use.

```
## ⚠️Important Considerations and Limitations
* **Input Language**: Currently, the application processes **English text only** for translation. This was a deliberate design choice for complexity management and consistent quality.
* **gTTS Language Support**: gTTS has a limited set of supported languages for speech synthesis.
* **File Size**: Maximum upload size is 200MB.
* **No Reak-Time Preview**: Translation and audio generation automatically occurs after text is submitted.
* **No GPU Support**: If deploying on Streamlit Commutity Cloud. This can lead to slower inference times as computational demands grow with more complex/larger tasks.
